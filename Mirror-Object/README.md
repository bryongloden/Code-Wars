# Mirror - rorriM

Can you mirror the properties on an object?

Given an object with properties with no value
<p><code>
abc: -<br>
arara: -<br>
xyz: -<br>
</code></p>
Return a new object that have the properties with its mirrored key!
<p><code>
abc: cba<br>
arara: arara<br>
xyz: zyx<br>
</code></p>
"You cannot change the original object, because if you did that the reflection would change."
